promise is an object that tells us whether the evente we performent is pending, fulfilled or rejected 

a fetch() promise only rejects when a network error is encoutered (which is usually when there is permisions issur or similar.). A fetch() promise does not reject on HTTP error (404 , etc ). Instead , a then() handler must check the Response.ok  and or Response.status properties.
